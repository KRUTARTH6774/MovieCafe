## An Introduction
OTT services like Netflix, Disney+Hotstar, and Hulu are now gaining popularity quickly. The Covid-19 epidemic let this site attract a large number of consumers. As a result, individuals now choose to watch content on OTT platforms first.

Providing such a platform with expanded functionality is the goal of our platform, MovieCafe. a platform that is user-friendly, simple to use, and reasonably priced. a website that offers all kinds of entertainment stuff. Our platform will also assist independent creators in uploading their work to our OTT platform and reaching interested viewers.



### Issue with Current Platforms



1. Existing platforms appear to be user-centric in their development, but often include additional features that require subscriptions before consumers can utilise them.
2. No option for creators' to upload their content and show their creativity.

## Motivation
Sole motivation was to complete this as course project what-so-ever but our dedication to this was left alive! Hence, it is open for open-source contributions.
